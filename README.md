REQUIREMENTS: Mods: @CBA_3;@Ace3;@task_force_radio

Use

To use insert all of these files into your mission and make modifications if you wish. Please do not re-release this framework. Once all of the files are in your mission you are finished and the mission can be played. If you do not know what you are doing when editing, DO NOT EDIT because there is a chance you could break the framework. Enjoy!

Features

This mission framework is built with ACE3 and CBA, so to use this framework the most recent versions of ACE3 and CBA are required to run when playing with this framework. Keep in mind this framework is all still WIP.


Headless Clients

There is a module for headless clients that works but is not perfect. If you are running headless clients then run no more than 3. If you aren't, then edit the file "xon\main\init.sqf" so that it doesn't load up the headless clients module.
