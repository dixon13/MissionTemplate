Use
To use insert all of these files into your mission and make modifications if you wish. Please do not re-release this framework. Once all of the files are in your mission you are finished and the mission can be played. If you do not know what you are doing when editing, DO NOT EDIT because there is a chance you could break the framework. Enjoy!
